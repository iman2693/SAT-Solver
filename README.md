# Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) Solver

This Python program serves as a basic implementation of a Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) solver. The solver determines whether a given propositional logic expression can be satisfied by assigning truth values to its variables.

## Features

- Solves SAT problems using a brute-force approach.
- Handles basic logical symbols: AND (^, ∧), OR (v, ∨), NOT (~, ¬), THEN (>), IFF (<>).
- Supports single-character variable names.
- Generates all possible interpretations to check satisfiability.
